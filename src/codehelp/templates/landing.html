      <h2>For Instructors</h2>
      <p>SoftEngStudio helps your students <strong>without writing code</strong> for them. It is made specifically to
        guide and explain but not provide solution code.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Accessible Support</strong> &mdash; It is always available, whenever your students are working,
          with immediate responses.</li>
        <li><strong>Tailored Responses</strong> &mdash; You can provide context to tailor responses to your class or
          even individual assignments, matching your students' needs and exactly what they are working on.</li>
        <li><strong>Valuable Insights</strong> &mdash; Quickly see where your students are having trouble and what
          they're asking.</li>
        <li><strong>Low Cost</strong> &mdash; Each student query costs roughly US$0.01 (see <a href="#costs">costs</a>
          below).</li>
        <li><strong>Simple Integration</strong> &mdash; SoftEngStudio easily fits into any existing course as a
          complement to existing support systems.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>SoftEngStudio is shared with everyone in your class with a simple link. There are two options:</p>
      <div class="pl-5">
        <a class="button button-inline is-link is-size-5"
          href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfsOZteMbIlIN5_MPZF-_Z-f9LwfZpfrhPOVfqcGjeJCtxHHQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">

        <ul class="mt-1 mb-4">
          <li>Everyone will sign in <b>automatically</b> (no separate login) via a link from your course page.</li>
          <li>Takes some time to set up, and may require support from your LMS administrator.</li>
        </ul>

        {% if auth['user_id'] and auth['auth_provider'] != 'demo' %}
        <a class="button button-inline is-link is-size-5" href="{{ url_for('profile.main') }}">
          Go to your Profile page
        </a> to manually create a class.
        {% else %}
        <a class="button button-inline is-link is-size-5"
          href="{{ url_for('auth.login', next=url_for('profile.main')) }}">
          Sign in using Google, GitHub, or Microsoft
        </a> and manually create a class from your profile page.
        {% endif %}

        <ul class="mt-1 mb-4">
          <li>You will share an access link, and everyone will sign in using a Google, GitHub, or Microsoft account.
          </li>
          <li>Can be set up in less than ten minutes.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="box content">
      <h2 id="costs">Costs</h2>
      <p>SoftEngStudio itself does not take payment, but the OpenAI large language models it uses are not free. We
        will ask you to provide an OpenAI API key to be used for your students' queries.</p>
      <p>Costs are low: OpenAI will charge you roughly US$0.01 for each query made with the default GPT-4o model. If
        your students use SoftEngStudio regularly and average 50 queries each over a semester (higher than the average
        we've observed), your total costs would be roughly $0.50 per student.</p>
      <p>(The GPT-4o-mini model is also available, and it is much less expensive though also less accurate and
        helpful. The same scenario above would cost about $0.02 per student if using GPT-4o-mini.)</p>
